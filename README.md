Smart cities work mutually with data and technology for efficient results and make better decisions to improve the standard of life . Real-time data give the unfold picture from the citizenâ€™s perspective , understand the area of concern, and respond faster. Various city models are proposed with various dimensions and indicators to follow for the evolution of a city into a smart city. Now a days citizens are rising complaints and problems about the services by interacting directly with the respective social network profiles(water, transportation, energy etc) of the government entities using social networks as a gateway. In this paper we applied machine learning algorithms over the preprocessed data collected from Twitter to create classifiers that categorize citizens messages into smart cities services dimension. The classifiers generated here can be integrated into various city services and systems like Government Support decision systems, customer complaint systems, police offices , transportation companies, environmental agencies. The extracted tweets are vectorized using countVectorizer and TF_IDF vectorizer. The various supervised machine learning algorithms used in this project are Random Forest, Decision Tree Classifier, K Nearest Neighbor Classifier. Supervised machine learning models are trained and tested using the vectorizers.
